## Research

My current research interest is verification of concurrent programs, more specifically using **Dynamic Partial Order Reduction** techniques. I am part of [**aSSIst Project**](https://assist-project.github.io/). Before that, I worked in the area of **Weak Memory Models**. During masters, I worked on the area of **Invariant generation**.
